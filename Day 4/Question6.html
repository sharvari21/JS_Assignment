<!-- Rewrite the function using ? or ||
Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100, If the visitor enters another number, ask them to input again.
The loop must ask for a number until either visitor enters the number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There's no need to implement a social handling for non-numeric input in this task. -->
